# Local Weather Prediction Project

#### **Overview: Build an ML model to predict tomorrow's temperature in your city using historical weather data and your own observations.**

## **Data Collection**:

#### Historical Data:

Fellows can get their city's historical weather data from:

- WeatherAPI (free tier)
- OpenWeatherMap API (free tier)

#### Your Observations (3 days):

        Record 3x daily (morning, afternoon, evening):

        Temperature

        Cloud cover (clear/partly/cloudy)

        Wind (calm/breezy/windy)

        Any precipitation

        Take a sky photo each time

---

### Required Project Elements:

#### Data Collection

Set up a simple spreadsheet for your 3-day observations

        Take sky photos with each observation

        Download 6 months of historical data for your city

        Document any unusual weather events

---

#### Model Building

        Clean and combine your data

        Use k-NN to predict next day's temperature

        Compare predictions with actual temperatures

        Document what features seemed most important

#### Presentation

        Create a 2-minute video showing:

        Your data collection process (show your photos!)

        Walk through one prediction attempt

        Share what surprised you about weather patterns

        Explain any challenges you faced

        Keep it casual but informative

        Show your personality!

#### Required Tools:

        Python (with numpy, pandas, scikit-learn)

        Phone/camera for photos

        Spreadsheet for data recording

        Weather API access (free tier)
